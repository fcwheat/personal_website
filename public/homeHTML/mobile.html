            <p style = "display:inline;">was the final project for my software engineering course that I took in fall of 2013. My team developed Lantern using the Android SDK within Eclipse and used the libGDX game development framework to assist us. The code itself was written in Java and XML.

             <p> I served as the project lead for this project and also as a developer. As project lead it was my job to maintain and coordinate all aspects of the project and ensure that the project was completed and ready to publish by the due date. We published the game to the Play Store on Dec. 10th 2013 - before the deadline - and recieved an A for our efforts. </p>
