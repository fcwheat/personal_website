            <p style = "display:inline;">is a tool for synthetic biologists that is designed to make it easy for them to generate datasheets. I was brought on to the project just a few days before the paper this tool is based on went to its reviewers.
            I worked to patch a number of bugs that had been logged by people on the team that pertained to stylings as well as functionality.</p>

      <p> The bulk of my work was on the front end working with Javascript. Through a combination of Node.js and Cloudinary (an image hosting service) I was able to integrate the ability to upload images through the tool. All of the bugs were patched when the paper went to the reviewers.</p>
