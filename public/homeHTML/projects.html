            <h2 style = "color:#79B3AF;display:inline;">Duster</h2>
            <p style = "display:inline;">was created by myself and Adlai Gordon at Make_BU 2014, Boston University's first hackathon. Designed to help people find the Facebook friends that they aren't actually good friends with and provide an interface for removing them, Duster served as my first hackathon project and first Node.js application.</p>

             <p>Duster was used by over <strong>38,000</strong>
            unique users and was used to defriend nearly <strong>450,000</strong> people in the span of a few weeks. This was possible in large part to two articles that were written - one by the <a href = "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/16/duster-facebook-unfriend_n_5337247.html?utm_hp_ref=technology"> Huffington Post </a> and another by <a href = "https://www.yahoo.com/tech/try-duster-a-handy-app-that-tells-you-which-friends-85841760589.html">Yahoo News</a>.
            The spike in traffic that the site received from these news sources was something that I had never had to manage before and immediatly after, resulted in nights with very little sleep.</p>

            <p> Soon after a few national articles were written about Duster, international articles started to pop up as well. <strong>5</strong> days after the first article was written about Duster, Adlai and I receieved emails from Facebook that they were shutting the application down.
             We were told that we had violated Facebook Platform Policy 4.4 - we had limited the functionality of Facebook. </p>
             <br>
             <p> I consider Duster to be a wonderful success. What started out as an idea in my head, <i>in 24 hours</i>, turned into a functioning tool that people throughout the world found useful. While it was disappointing to see it get shut down rest assured that Duster is not truly gone, I have something in the works...</p>
