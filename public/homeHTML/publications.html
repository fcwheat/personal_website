            <p style = "display:inline;"> have been incredibly fortunate to have been a part of a research team at the Beckman Laser Institute at the University of California, Irvine. While my interests currently lie in software development for industry, I am very proud of the contributions that I was able to make to biomedical research. The software tools that I built were all written in MATLAB and predominantly dealt with image processing.</p>
