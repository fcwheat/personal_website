          <p>For those of you that don't know, the Pebble is the smartwatch that took the wearable tech industry by storm in May of 2012 when it raised $10,266,844 in a single month on Kickstarter<sup>1</sup>. Since then, the Pebble has done incredibly well in the market with recent reports claiming that it accounted for around 35% of all wearables shipped in the first quarter of this year<sup>2</sup>. With a new model of their watches, the Pebble Steel, and a new application store things seem to be looking good for Pebble Technology Corporation.</p>
          <p>Despite the positive outlook that one might be able to take when looking at this company, there exists a very real threat on the horizon for Pebble. This summer the Moto360 will be released, powered by Android Wear, and it is rumored that Apple will also release a wearable watch later this year<sup>3</sup>. Bfoth of these products will be able to take over the market for the phones that they are supported for. When it comes to a lifestyle product that a person would wear to work and at home, both of these product will perform very well. </p>

          <p>If the Pebble is going to survive the emergence of these major competitors it needs to be able to find some way to differentiate itself. I don't believe that the differentiation can come from its design, internal technology, or applications. The Moto360 and the iWatch will outperform the Pebble in each of these categories.</p>
          <p>The only possible way that Pebble can stay afloat is if it comes to brand itself as the affordable smartwatch. From a production standpoint I am not sure how much of a price cut that Pebble can afford to make, but whatever they can make in terms of a price reduction, they should and should time it with the still yet to be announced, release of the rumored iWatch. </p>

          <p>Pebble faces an uphill battle as this year goes on. I am not saying that I am one to jump ship at the first sign of trouble, I just recognize the magnitude of the trouble that Pebble Technology Corporation is going to face. If I worked for the company, I would throw everything that I could on brainstorming how we could weather the coming storm. There are ways for the product to still do well and hold a place in the market. Major developments need to take place in order for this to happen.</p>
